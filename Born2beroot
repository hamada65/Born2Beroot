##Virtualization

Virtualization is a technology that allows multiple operating systems (OS) or instances of an OS to run on a single physical computer,

##VM
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It allows you to run an operating system (OS) within another operating system. In other words, it creates a virtualized environment that simulates the hardware and software of a physical computer.

## WHY DEBIAN ?
Debian is highly recommended if you are new to system administration
Debian is one of the oldest and most widely used Linux distributions. 
Debian has a stable release cycle with long periods between major releases.
Debian uses the APT (Advanced Package Tool) package management system, which simplifies the process of installing, updating, and removing software packages.

### DIFF between Debian and Rocky
debian 1993 rock 2021
debian stable than Rocky

## Benefits of virtual machine
Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical host
VMS can be easily cloned or snapshotted
dynamic allocatiob of resources and flexible management (CPU, Memory, Storage)
test software without affecting their host system or other VM

### Diff between apt and aptitude
apt more easily than aptitude : like aptitude can manage the package dependencies and more things
When facing a package conflict, `apt` will not fix the issue while `aptitude` will suggest a resolution that can do the job

## apparmor
AppArmor acts as a protector by enforcing access control policies on processes and limiting their capabilities

##UFW
Uncomplicated Firewall : asier for users to set up and manage a firewall without dealing with complex iptables syntax.

##SSH
Secure Shell :  is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over a potentially unsecured network

##Cron
It is a daemon process that runs tasks or commands at predetermined times or intervals
